# JobRadar Autofill — Usage Guide

## Daily Workflow (20 applications in ~1 hour)

1. Open Gmail — find today's JobRadar digest
2. Open all "Apply Now" links in new tabs
3. On each job page, follow the steps below

## Step-by-Step Per Application

### CRITICAL ORDER — do not reverse this

1. **Upload resume first** — drag AN_Resume.pdf onto the upload area
2. **Wait 2-3 seconds** — let the company's auto-parse finish (watch the form settle)
3. **Open console** — Cmd+Option+I
4. **Run autofill script** — Up arrow (reuses last command) → Enter
5. **Review filled fields** — check name, email, phone, LinkedIn are correct
6. **Upload resume again if needed** — some forms reset after autofill
7. **Submit**

### Why this order matters
If you run the script BEFORE uploading the resume, the company's auto-parser fires after and overwrites your clean data with its (often wrong) interpretation of the PDF. Always let the parser go first, then our script corrects anything it got wrong.

4. Select all (Cmd+A), copy (Cmd+C)

## vs Simplify / JobRight (Chrome Extensions)

| | JobRadar Autofill | Simplify / JobRight |
|--|--|--|
| Safari support | ✅ Yes | ❌ Chrome only |
| EEO fields (veteran, disability, race) | ✅ Fully filled | ❌ Skipped |
| Cover letter auto-paste | ✅ From clipboard | ❌ Not supported |
| Privacy | ✅ Runs locally, nothing uploaded | ❌ Resume sent to their servers |
| Cost | ✅ Free forever | ❌ $30/month for pro |
| Customizable | ✅ You own the code | ❌ No |
| One-click | ❌ Console required (2-3 steps) | ✅ Browser extension click |
| Application history tracking | ❌ Not yet | ✅ Built-in |
| ATS coverage out of the box | Growing (6 so far) | 500K+ users, battle-tested |

**Bottom line:** Use JobRadar autofill for EEO-heavy forms, Safari, and cover letter pasting. Simplify wins on convenience if you switch to Chrome. Long-term, JobRadar autofill will be embedded directly into the JobRadar dashboard as a proper extension.

## Cover Letter

The script reads your clipboard. Before running autofill:
- Copy the cover letter from the JobRadar email (Cmd+C)
- The script pastes it into the cover letter field automatically (where supported)
